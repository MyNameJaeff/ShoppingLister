# ShoppingLister
 
## An app for saving paper and money
With this you have no need for shopping lists on paper because this app does it but better.

## It links to a whole household
Have you ever forgotten to add something to the shopping list? Well with this you dont have to get a pen nor send a text to the one shopping, but instead you can just add it on the app and it will update for everyone with the same household key

## Easy to operate and explain to others
If you want to make a shopping list for your own household all you have to do is add an non-existing key when asked and it will create its own part on our database. Then the others you want to share said list with only have to type in your set key and they will be connected to the same list as you are.

## Easy to switch between diffrent households
Top left of the app there's a button for removing the inputted key. Then the app will refresh and ask you for a key once again.
